## WCA stats helper

[![Build Status](https://www.travis-ci.com/louismeunier/wca-stats-helper.svg?branch=main)](https://www.travis-ci.com/louismeunier/wca-stats-helper)

A "pseudo-api" wrapper of the WCA SQL export (available [here](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/misc/export.html)). It should be noted that this is heavily inspired by https://github.com/jonatanklosko/wca_statistics, though with different intentions.
